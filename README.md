# AR/VR group Project - Colour blindness detection in VR
Objective:
To implement Color blindness tests from the established literature as a VR-application to digitally test color-blindedness in users.

Solution Approach:
The aim of the project is to provide the users a way of detecting their specific colorblindness with the help of specific color maze or puzzle.

Rule:
The maze-walls are designed in a way that the person with normal eye vision will see different colors on his walls of the pathways, but will appear different to the person with color blindness.

The user is prompted to turn left in case he sees the maze walls of different color or turn right if the maze walls are of same color.

At the end of course user gets the prompt about the type of color blindness he is facing.
Score Calulation:
User has to go through few levels which will cover the tests for all the three deficiencies that is, Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia.
